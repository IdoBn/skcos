1. socks client connects to the relay server
2. relay server listens ahead of time to a connection from the socks server.
3. relay server connects the new (incomming socks client connection) to the previously held socks server connection.
    3.1. the two new sockets are somehow mapped together...
3. socks server initiates a new connection to the relay server as soon as it gets data to it's previous connection. this way we can handle multiple connections at once.
4. data is passed between the two sockets until one of them disconnects
